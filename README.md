Apartment Price Analysis Project

In this project, I developed a comprehensive tool to analyze apartment prices using a variety of technologies and techniques.

Data Collection - 
I began by scraping data from a website using Beautiful Soup. This allowed me to gather detailed information about apartment listings, including features such as location, building type, number of rooms, and price.

Data Storage - 
The scraped data was then stored in an SQLite database. This provided a structured and efficient way to manage and query the collected information.

Data Visualization - 
To bring the data to life, I used Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit to create interactive visualizations. These visualizations enable users to explore the dataset in a user-friendly manner, uncovering insights and trends in apartment prices.

Predictive Modeling - 
As a final step, I implemented a Random Forest model. This model allows users to input specific features of an apartment and predict its price.

Live Application - 
You can explore the interactive visualizations and try out the predictive model by visiting the page: https://apartment-price-analysis.streamlit.app/
